## A Fly in the Ointment

"A fly in the ointment" is an English idiom that refers to a small defect or problem that spoils an otherwise flawless plan, situation, or circumstance.

The phrase originates from the Bible, in Ecclesiastes 10:1, where it is used to convey the idea that a small amount of folly can outweigh wisdom and honor, much like a tiny fly can spoil a large jar of perfume or ointment.

In modern usage, if someone mentions "a fly in the ointment," they are typically pointing out a minor issue or drawback that prevents a situation from being perfect or satisfactory.

For example, if you say, "The car is in perfect condition, but the high price is a fly in the ointment," you are saying that the car is great, but its cost is a problem.

## Baggage

The term "baggage" can have different meanings depending on the context. Here are some of its common uses:

Physical Luggage: In the most literal sense, baggage refers to the bags, suitcases, and other items that you carry with you when you travel. This could be anything from a small handbag or backpack to large suitcases, and it might include clothes, toiletries, books, electronic devices, and other personal belongings.

Emotional Baggage: In a metaphorical sense, baggage can refer to the past traumas, issues, or burdens that a person carries with them emotionally. These might be unresolved issues from past relationships, deeply ingrained fears or insecurities, or memories of traumatic events. This kind of "baggage" can affect a person's behavior and emotional well-being.

Data Baggage: In distributed tracing, baggage refers to the data that travels with the trace, like metadata that provides context for the trace.

## Banal

"Banal" is an adjective that originates from the French language. It is used to describe something that is so unoriginal, common, or ordinary as to be boring or uninspired. Essentially, it refers to something that lacks freshness, novelty, or excitement.

For example, if a movie plot is described as "banal," it means it's perceived as clichéd or predictable, offering nothing new or interesting to the viewer.

## Boilerplate

"Boilerplate"在编程中通常有两种含义：

"Boilerplate code"：这是指在多个地方重复出现的代码片段，这些代码有固定的模式或结构，而且往往几乎不需要修改。例如，许多编程语言的主函数，HTML文档的基本结构，或是特定框架或库的初始化代码等，都可以被认为是"boilerplate code"。

"Boilerplate text"：这是指在多个文档中重复出现的文本片段，通常在文档的开头或结尾。这种文本通常包含标准的条款或声明，例如版权声明、免责声明、使用许可等。这个概念源自法律和出版业，但也常用在编程和软件开发领域。

## "Relics from the past"

是一个短语，直译为"来自过去的遗物"。这通常指的是一些古老的、具有历史意义的物品、建筑或者文化现象，这些遗物作为过去历史时期或文化的物理证据，对现在的人们来说具有重要的价值。这些可以包括古代工具、武器、艺术品、建筑物、书籍、遗址等。

此外，"relics from the past"也可以被用作比喻，指代过时的观念、习俗或做法，表达它们已经不适应现代社会，但仍然在某些地方或者人群中存在。

## Terse

"Terse" 这个英文单词形容的是说话或者写作方式简洁到几乎显得有点粗鲁或者不友好。它既有“简洁”的正面含义，也可能带有“过于简短以至于显得冷淡或不耐烦”的负面色彩。具体是正面还是负面，往往取决于语境和说话人的意图。
